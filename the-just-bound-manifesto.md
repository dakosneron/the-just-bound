# The Just-Bound: A Structural Theory of Normative Legitimacy and Domination

## 1. Introduction: On the Nature of Political Theory
This work does not aim to promote an ideology, moral system, or political vision. It aims instead to clarify the structural conditions under which any norm may be said to be valid. By "valid," we mean: capable of being justified rationally, universally, and without contradiction. Where these conditions are not met, what remains is not necessarily chaos, but something worse: tyranny. This work explores the relationship between rational normativity and domination, and argues that only one position can withstand ethical collapse—the position of the just-bound.

## 2. The Inevitability of Domination
Domination is not an exception in political life — it is its default condition. Where reason fails, where structure is absent, where norms contradict themselves or apply selectively, power fills the void. Domination arises not because it is always willed, but because it is structurally permitted. There is no neutral ground where domination does not lurk; it waits at the threshold of every failed justification. This is not an indictment of all politics — it is simply the foundation upon which all claims to legitimacy must stand or fall. The question is not whether domination exists, but whether it can ever be just.

## 3. Definition of a Norm
A norm is a prescriptive claim. It asserts what one ought to do, or what ought to be permitted or prohibited. It is distinct from preferences, descriptions, or expressions of power. Once a norm is asserted, it invites structural evaluation: is it rational, universal, and self-binding?

## 5. Axiom I: The Norm Must Be Rational
A norm that contradicts itself—either in logic or in application—collapses. An agent who asserts an irrational norm cannot defend themselves when it is violated, because their standard has already failed. Rationality is the minimal requirement for normativity.

## 6. Axiom II: The Norm Must Be Universal
A norm must apply to all relevant agents, including the speaker. If it exempts the speaker or some preferred group, it creates a condition indistinguishable from tyranny. The moment one allows exemption, one permits domination.

## 7. The Bound and the Just-Bound
Any agent who lives under a norm is considered bound. This includes irrational, self-exempting, or tyrannical norms. But only agents who follow norms that are rational, universal, and non-tyrannical are considered just-bound. The just-bound are not ethically special—they are simply structurally coherent. And because of that, they are the only agents against whom domination cannot be justified.

## 8. Tyranny as the Minimal Norm
Tyranny is a valid norm in structure: it is rational and universal.
It permits domination by any who are able. It makes no exemptions.
In this way, it is not a deviation from ethics—it is ethics reduced to zero.
To be bound to tyranny or to nothing at all is the same: you are at anyone’s mercy — without defense or claim.

## 9. The Greater Tyrant
The Greater Tyrant, bound to tyranny, permits domination universally — and therefore permits his own.
He does not claim safety — he claims power.
But tyranny offers no shield, even to its master.
He may dominate today, but he lives by a rule that invites domination by any who are greater.
And when that day comes, he cannot say it is wrong — only that he lost.

## 10. Just Domination
Domination is just if it is rationally justifiable within the norm of the dominated.
If an agent follows a norm that permits domination — either through contradiction, irrationality, or exemption — then domination of them is not merely possible, but just.
They cannot say it ought not be done — because they already said it may.
The Greater Tyrant is not exempt. He permits domination universally — and so he permits his own.
This is the law of tyranny: what it grants, it cannot withhold.
And so, domination against the Greater Tyrant is just.

## 11. The Misbound: Those Bound to Irrational Norms
If you deny the axiom of rationality, what you have left are norms with no internal coherence.
They cannot protest domination because their position is already broken.
The Greater Tyrant may dominate them—not because he is right, but because they have no valid ground to say he is wrong.
And so domination against the misbound is just — not because it is good, but because it cannot be refuted.

## 12. The Self-Exempting: Those Bound to Non-Universal Norms
If you deny the axiom of universality, then you have already accepted that some may stand above others.
And so, when the Greater Tyrant exempts himself from your norm and strikes you, he is not violating your principle — he is fulfilling it.
You cannot say he is wrong, because your logic has already permitted him.
And so, domination against the self-exempting is just — not because it is fair, but because it is permitted by their own logic.

## 13. The Just-Bound
The just-bound follows a rational, universal, non-tyrannical norm. This norm does not permit domination. The Greater Tyrant may still strike the just-bound—but he cannot rationally justify it — not without abandoning universality. And the moment he does that, he creates a permission — and a path — for a tyrant greater than himself to strike justly. The just-bound, though not invulnerable, is structurally untouchable.
And so domination against the just-bound is unjust — not because it is cruel, but because it cannot be rationally defended on his terms.

## 14. Derivations

## 14.1. The misbound and self-exempting are greater tyrants in disguise
They want the power to prescribe, but not the burden of universality or rationality.
They perform ethics, but structure tyranny.
The misbound and self-exempting often claim moral authority.
They often present themselves as victims, reformers, or saviors.
But structurally, they’re doing exactly what the Greater Tyrant does: Creating conditions where domination is permitted — for themselves.
In this sense, they are more dangerous than the Greater Tyrant: he declares the game openly. They demand the right to dominate, and then ask for protection when dominated in return.
They do not fail because they are weak — they fail because their structure collapses the moment it is tested.

## 14.2. Hypocrisy is unbinding
If an agent asserts a norm but does not follow it, the norm collapses.
This is a violation of universality — the speaker has created a rule for others, but not for themselves.
The norm, though spoken, is null.
A norm that exempts its own author is not a norm — it is an attempt at domination.
And domination, once permitted, cannot be withheld.
Hypocrisy is not merely a judgement of character here, it is the collapse of the very norm he is trying to argue for.

## 15. Possible rebuttals

## 15.1. It Ignores Human Emotion, Intuition, and Cultural Norms
It is often said that ethics is not just logic — that it is embedded in psychology, culture, empathy, lived experience, even power and material conditions. This work does not deny those things exist. It denies only that they are sufficient to justify a norm. Norms do not require context. They require structure.
This theory is cold because it must be. It is brutal because the world is. If you invoke compassion or culture to violate universality, then you are not exempting yourself from tyranny — you are authoring it. You are the Greater Tyrant.
There is no escape. Only rational, universal, non-tyrannical norms provide protection — not from harm, but from collapse.

## 15.2. The Work Ignores Moral Substance
It is also claimed that rationality and universality are not enough — that ethics must include moral substance. That formal coherence does not equal moral worth. This work agrees. And that is precisely the point.
Tyranny is structurally valid. It permits domination universally. It cannot be refuted — only chosen or rejected. Most people live on it now. Most governments enforce it. Most norms collapse on inspection.
This work does not try to make tyranny immoral — it makes it indefensible. You may choose tyranny. But you may not complain when it turns against you. That is the only law tyranny respects.
Its deterrent is not moral — it is structural. You will not always be the strongest. Someone greater will come. And when they do, they will strike you down — justly.

## 16. Conclusion: Coherence as the Last Resistance
This theory does not promise safety. It does not promise peace. It only promises clarity. In a world where domination may always occur, only one position cannot be rationally condemned: the position of the just-bound. All others collapse—by contradiction, by exemption, or by their own logic. Tyranny may rule. But it can never justify itself when it strikes the coherent.
